### Weather Demo ###

This demo will show the workflow of using the geolocation API, weather API and a "trigger" API to retrieve the 
geolocation of the requesting service caller, getting the weather information, and then make a call to the trigger 
API with that information so the resulting trigger can do something based on tht data.
